    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Sentara (“the App”) helps adults reflect on emotions and receive AI-assisted insights. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>
      <p><strong>Audience:</strong> Sentara is intended for adults (18+) and is <em>not</em> directed to children.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account &amp; Subscription Data (if you subscribe):</strong> purchase tokens and entitlements from the app store (e.g., Google Play Billing and/or RevenueCat) so the App can unlock premium features on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>App Activity (on your device):</strong> mood check-ins, reflections, and settings you choose to save. By default, these live <em>locally on your device</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Diagnostics (minimal):</strong> basic, non-identifying signals needed for reliability and fraud prevention built into the app store purchase flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>We do not sell personal data.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core features (mood tracking, reflections, AI insights) and personalize your experience on-device.</li>
        <li>Verify and honor purchases/subscriptions.</li>
        <li>Maintain app reliability and safety.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI &amp; Cloud Processing (OpenAI)</h2>
      <p>To generate insights, the App sends your prompts and strictly necessary context to the <strong>OpenAI API</strong>. Transmission is encrypted in transit. We do <em>not</em> run our own servers for processing your content.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What we send:</strong> the text you provide (e.g., a reflection prompt) and minimal context needed for a useful response.</li>
        <li><strong>What we store:</strong> <em>We do not keep server-side copies</em> of your prompts or AI outputs. Any entries you save remain on your device unless you delete them.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI policies:</strong> Processing by OpenAI is governed by OpenAI’s terms and privacy documentation. Please review OpenAI’s policies for their retention and security practices.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Device Data:</strong> mood history, reflections, and settings are stored locally on your device until <em>you</em> delete them (e.g., via in-app controls, clearing app data, or uninstalling the app).</li>
        <li><strong>Server-Side by Us:</strong> <em>None.</em> We do not maintain our own databases of your content.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> proof of purchase and entitlement status are retained by the app store and/or RevenueCat as part of the standard subscription infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> if you email us, your message and address exist in our email inbox until we no longer need them to assist you, or you ask us to delete them.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>We share data only with service providers necessary to operate the App:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> (AI processing of your prompts).</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play / App Store &amp; RevenueCat</strong> (purchase and subscription management, where applicable).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These providers are bound by their own terms and data-protection obligations. We may also disclose information if required by law, to protect rights, or to prevent fraud or abuse.</p>
      <p><strong>What we do not use:</strong> no third-party marketing trackers, and no server-side analytics owned by us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage privacy and data settings in the App (e.g., clear local history).</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App to remove local data from your device.</li>
        <li>Request access, correction, export, or deletion assistance by emailing <a href="mailto:swaydev369@gmail.com">swaydev369@gmail.com</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The App is intended for adults (18+) and is not directed to children. If you believe a minor has provided information, contact us and we will assist with deletion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard safeguards (including encryption in transit) to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we continuously improve protections.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own due to how cloud services operate. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and, when appropriate, notify you in-app.</p>
