    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Sentara (“the App”) helps you track emotions, reflect, and receive AI-assisted insights. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account &amp; Subscription Data:</strong> email, purchase tokens, and entitlements from app stores (e.g., Google Play/RevenueCat) to manage your subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> check-ins, reflections, mood history, and feature usage you choose to save on your device or sync.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> basic device and app diagnostics (e.g., app version, OS version, crash logs) for reliability and abuse prevention.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>We do not sell personal data.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core features (mood tracking, reflections, AI insights) and personalize your experience.</li>
        <li>Manage purchases and subscriptions.</li>
        <li>Improve app stability, performance, and safety.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI &amp; Cloud Processing</h2>
      <p>To generate insights, the App may securely send your prompts and relevant context to AI services. We minimize the data sent and use encryption in transit. Consult our in-app settings to control what’s shared.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Device:</strong> Many entries (like mood history) are stored locally unless you choose to back up or sync.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud:</strong> If you enable features requiring cloud services (e.g., subscriptions, notifications), related data is stored as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes above or as required by law.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>We share data with vendors only to operate the App (e.g., payments, analytics, crash reporting, AI processing). These providers are bound by confidentiality and data-protection obligations. We may disclose information if required by law, to protect rights, or to prevent fraud or abuse.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjust privacy and data settings in the App.</li>
        <li>Request access, correction, export, or deletion by emailing <a href="mailto:support@yourdomain.com">support@yourdomain.com</a>.</li>
        <li>Opt-out of optional analytics if offered in settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe we’ve collected data from a child, contact us to request deletion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard safeguards to protect your data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we continually improve our protections.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and, when appropriate, notify you in-app.</p>
    </section>
