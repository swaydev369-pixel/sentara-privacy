    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Disclaimer — Not Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>Sentara is a wellness and self-improvement tool. It is <strong>not a medical or mental health service</strong>, and it does not provide diagnosis, treatment, or professional advice.

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account &amp; Subscription Data (if you subscribe):</strong> purchase tokens and entitlements from the app store (e.g., Google Play Billing and/or RevenueCat) so the App can unlock premium features on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>App Activity (on your device):</strong> mood check-ins, reflections, and settings you choose to save. By default, these live <em>locally on your device</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Diagnostics (minimal):</strong> basic, non-identifying signals needed for reliability and fraud prevention built into the app store purchase flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>We do not sell personal data.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core features (mood tracking, reflections, AI insights) and personalize your experience on-device.</li>
        <li>Verify and honor purchases/subscriptions.</li>
        <li>Maintain app reliability and safety.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI &amp; Cloud Processing (OpenAI)</h2>
      <p>To generate insights, the App sends your prompts and strictly necessary context to the <strong>OpenAI API</strong>. Transmission is encrypted in transit. We do <em>not</em> run our own servers for processing your content.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What we send:</strong> the text you provide (e.g., a reflection prompt) and minimal context needed for a useful response.</li>
        <li><strong>What we store:</strong> <em>We do not keep server-side copies</em> of your prompts or AI outputs. Any entries you save remain on your device unless you delete them.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI policies:</strong> Processing by OpenAI is governed by OpenAI’s terms and privacy documentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Device Data:</strong> mood history, reflections, and settings are stored locally on your device until <em>you</em> delete them (e.g., via in-app controls, clearing app data, or uninstalling the app).</li>
        <li><strong>Server-Side by Us:</strong> <em>None.</em> We do not maintain our own databases of your content.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> proof of purchase and entitlement status are retained by the app store and/or RevenueCat as part of the standard subscription infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> if you email us, your message and address exist in our email inbox until we no longer need them to assist you, or you ask us to delete them.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>We share data only with service providers necessary to operate the App:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> (AI processing of your prompts).</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play / App Store &amp; RevenueCat</strong> (purchase and subscription management, where applicable).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These providers act on our instructions and are bound by their own terms and data-protection obligations. We may also disclose information if required by law, to protect rights, or to prevent fraud or abuse.</p>
      <p><strong>What we do not use:</strong> no third-party marketing trackers, and no server-side analytics owned by us.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-deletion">
      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>Users can delete their data at any time in two ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>In-App:</strong> open <em>Sentara</em> &rarr; <em>Settings</em> &rarr; <em>Privacy</em> &rarr; <em>Clear Data</em>. This removes your locally stored mood history, reflections, and settings from your device.</li>
        <li><strong>By Email Request:</strong> email us at <a href="mailto:swaydev369@gmail.com?subject=Delete%20my%20data%20(Sentara)">swaydev369@gmail.com</a> with the subject “Delete my data (Sentara)”. If you have an active subscription, you may include your order ID to help us verify entitlement records maintained by the app store/RevenueCat.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>What gets deleted:</strong> On-device entries (mood history, reflections, settings) via the in-app control. For email requests, we will delete support emails we hold and, where applicable, request removal of associated identifiers from our processors to the extent they are not required for fraud prevention, security, or legal compliance.</p>
      <p><strong>What is retained:</strong> App store purchase records may be retained by Google Play/App Store and/or RevenueCat as required for billing, refunds, chargebacks, fraud prevention, and legal obligations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage privacy and data settings in the App (e.g., clear local history).</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App to remove local data from your device.</li>
        <li>Request access, correction, export, or deletion assistance by emailing <a href="mailto:swaydev369@gmail.com">swaydev369@gmail.com</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard safeguards (including encryption in transit) to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we continuously improve protections.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own due to how cloud services operate. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and, when appropriate, notify you in-app.</p>
